                It is essential that you know how to create folder structures to store your work. 
                <br />
                Some of your work will primarily be stored on your laptop, such as screen shots that you will make to prove that you have accomplished certain tasks.<br />
                Use File Explorer to create a series of folders on your C: drive with the path: ' <span id="xpath"></span>'<br />


                Enter your WSU StarID, such as wp8798rh into the text box at the top.<br />
                Enter the course you are in, such as BUSA353...into the text box at the top, then press F5<br />
                You will be using this folder structure for storing screen shots and other working documents throughout this course.

                <p>Note: you are welcome to use the multiple monitors in Somsen 301 whenever the classroom is available.</p>
                <p>
                    Your HP laptop can support two external monitors through VGA and DisplayPort cables (G2 or G3); or HDMI and USB-C Thunderbolt to DisplayPort cables (x360); or USB-C Dock (x360 only) .
                </p>
                <p>
                    A MacBook Pro can use multiple monitors, the best solution is to use a CalDigit TS3+ hub in Somsen 301 or 329.<br />
                    Why are additional screens necessary?  Some reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conveniently run multiple software applications on separate monitors</li>
                    <li>Easily copy and paste data between open applications</li>
                    <li>Participate in Adobe Connect web conference while also running other applications</li>
                    <li>Watch  class recordings while also running other applications</li>
                    <li>Be able to keep Outlook open in one monitor at all times</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To setup, use and disconnect an external monitor from your laptop follow the instructions below.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>Somsen 301 is equipped with dual external LCD monitors for the instructor and each of the  students to increase productivity.  This  arrangement permits the display of several applications on each monitor. External  monitors promote the use of multiple applications such as video conferencing,  web browsers and eBooks.  An eBook can be displayed on one  monitor, a spreadsheet application is displayed  on another and a web video conferencing session is on the third  monitor.  The mouse will move freely and smoothly between monitors that are correctly oriented.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>Note: the Intel HD Graphics Control Panel looks slightly different on the x360.</p>
                <p>When using LCD projectors or video conferencing screen sharing you can have a ‘public’ and ‘private’ display. The primary laptop display can be private, viewable only by the user.  The external LCD monitor and the ceiling mounted LCD projector both display the same ‘public’ image.  This allows the user to view class notes, email, Desire2Learn information privately on their laptop.  Note that the user can still use their laptop and LCD projector to display the same image as is done now, and disregard the external LCD monitor.  This is known as ‘mirroring’. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect the VGA cable from the left-side monitor that is in 'portrait' mode to the VGA port on the left-side of your laptop.</li>
                    <li>Connect the DisplayPort cable from the right-side monitor to the DisplayPort on the right-side of your laptop.</li>
                    <li>Click the 'Start' button and type 'Intel HD Graphics', then start the Intel HD Graphics Control Panel application.</li>
                    <li>Choose 'Display' 
              
            and you will be presented with a dialog box that allows you to adjust the rotation of each monitor. Note that:
            <ol>
                <li>&quot;Monitor 1&quot; must be your laptop display</li>

                <li>&quot;Monitor 3&quot; should be your portrait display</li>
            </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>In the center section near the bottom select '90' for the 'Rotation'</li>
