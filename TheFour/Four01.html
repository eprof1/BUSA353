<h2 class="text-center">Company Analysis</h2>
<p>Comments on The Four by Bill Gallagher, taken from Amazon.com and edited.</p>
    <p>Strengths of The Four. Scott Galloway clearly has a sharp business mind; he is street smart, likeable, down-to-earth, and often funny; he can hold an audience&#8217;s interest and knows the online landscape very well.<br />
        He presents business concepts in a clear and well synthesized way, and doesn&#8217;t seem to be trying to sell us his own products or services.<br /><br />
        Weaknesses:
        Why not a five star rating then? While the book has some big thesis insights into the internet corporate behemoths and online commerce, it generally stays with the big part.<br />
        This is valuable, and most readers will walk away with some fresh insights.<br />
        However, once a big idea is noted, he tends to not delve deeper.<br />
        There were even a few times when The Four feels like a blog rant, giving him an opportunity to vent at one of the big companies (most notably that Apple wouldn&#8217;t help the FBI crack the code of an iPhone to help them gather evidence on a San Bernardino shooter/terrorist). He also spends a bit of time telling us some obvious things, though in fairness to Galloway, it is tricky to know what to leave out as common knowledge when you are writing for a general audience. As someone who knows a fair bit about ecommerce, I may be showing my bias here, but confirming my sense of some obviousness is the notably lower rating (at this writing at least) that Amazon readers of business books give the book compared to general readers. I also wish Galloway would have delved deeper into the cultural and political implications for society when a handful of companies dominate the digital economy and have outsized influence in nearly every sphere. He touches upon this, but just touches. Perhaps that is too much to ask of a business book, but even the bigger picture business implications don&#8217;t get 
        considered in a sustained way.<br />
        Galloway's shortfall comes from his impatience.<br />
        He says as much as he describes himself and his impatience comes across in some of the stories he tells about himself (most notably in his handling of his efforts to bludgeon the New York Times to change).<br />
        Ultimately this impatience leads to the book's greatest weakness. <br />
        Another example of The Four's superficiality/impatience: he casually refers to evolutionary &#8220;explanations&#8221; for business phenomenon.<br />
        I am very much inclined toward evolutionary explanations for human behavior as well, but they come off as tossed out there instead of carefully thought through.<br />
        Galloway&#8217;s breezy style also doesn&#8217;t help here. That is, Galloway enjoys being flip and cussing a fair bit.<br />
        And a tossed out flip dismissal is often used as a substitute for well crafted writing.<br />
        The Four has value, but it had potential be lots more.</p>
